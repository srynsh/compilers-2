loop semantic checks: DONE
brak_pred: only codegen left
add turtle
make yacc go on and detect more errors (KG doing -> KG)
codegen
operator overloading (for images, gray images and multi-dimensional arrays)
add convolution operator
in-built call statement
ID array_element in expr_pred
where do we stop at yyerror, and where do we not?
seg faults if we use undeclared on continuing (KG did, but not sure if it's right -> KG)
